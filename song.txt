Looks like I'm gonna do everything myself
Maybe I could use some help
But hell, you want something done right
You gotta do it yourself
Maybe life is up and down but
My life's been (what?) till now

I used to be alive
Now I feel pathetic and now I get it
What's done is done you just leave it alone and don't regret it
But sometimes, some things turn into dumb things
And that's when you put your foot down.
